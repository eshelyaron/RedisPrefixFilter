* Introduction

This report presents our work on implementing a Redis module that
provides an interface to the /Prefix Filter/ data structure.

The first section includes background about the prefix filter and
Redis in general.  The second section describes our implementation and
explore future directions for development.  In the third section we
evaluate our implementation compared to the standard Bloom Filter and
Cuckoo Filter Redis modules.  The fourth and final section concludes
our work and experiences.

* Background: what we learned about Redis and PF

** Prefix Filter
*** Theory

In \cite{even2022prefix}, the authors present the Prefix Filter, an
incremental filter that aims to be near optimal in its space
requirements, and provide fast queries and insertions, in comparison
to state-of-the-art filters.  Quoting \cite{even2022prefix}:

#+begin_quote
The prefix filter shares the common high-level structure of mod- ern
dynamic filters (hence, its space efficiency) but it exploits the lack
of deletion support to simultaneously obtain fast queries and
insertions... [It] uses a novel solution to the collision resolution
problem, in which typically only a single cache line is accessed per
filter operation.
#+end_quote

The prefix filter is a two-level structure, with each level storing
/key fingerprints/, which are short hashes of the keys stored in the
filter.  The first level is called the /bin table/, it is an array of
compact dictionaries that facilitate constant time operations.  These
dictionaries are called /pocket dictionaries/.  Pocket dictionaries have
a very limited capacity, thus not all key fingerprints reside in the
bin array.  The second level is called the /spare/. It holds
fingerprints of keys that were evicted from the bin array.  The spare
can implemented with any incremental filter.

The essence of the prefix key is the policy it employs to choose which
fingerprints to forward to the spare.  The policy maintains an
invariant called the /Prefix Invariant/:

\begin{invariant}[Prefix Invariant]
Each bin $i$ contains a prefix of the sorted list of key fingerprints
of keys that were inserted into the prefix filter and whose dedicated
bin is $i$.
\end{invariant}

*** Implementation

The FilterAPI struct is implemented in a cpp source file called "wrrapers.hpp". The prefix filter is a generic type, which implemented by FilterAPI:
#+begin_src cpp
template<typename filterTable>
struct FilterAPI<Prefix_Filter<filterTable>> {
  using Table = Prefix_Filter<filterTable>;
  #+end_src
  In wrapperc.hpp we find the implementation of the following methods:

  #1. ConstructFromAddCount: the constructor
  #+begin_src cpp
  static Table ConstructFromAddCount(size_t add_count)
  #+end_src
  #2. Add: add a key to the prefix filter
  #+begin_src cpp
  static void Add(u64 key, Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #3. get_max_capacity: get max capacity of items that the filter can contain
  #+begin_src cpp
  static auto get_max_capacity(Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #4. Remove: the implementaion is not supporting this method
  #+begin_src cpp
  static void Remove(u64 key, Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #5.  Contain: check if the prefix filter contais the key
  #+begin_src cpp
  CONTAIN_ATTRIBUTES static bool Contain(u64 key, const Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #6. get_name: returns the name of the filter
  #+begin_src cpp
  static std::string get_name(const Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #7. get_functionality: returns a bit that represents some capability of the filter. for example, the third bit represents capability of deletions.
  #+begin_src cpp
  static auto get_functionality(const Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #8. get_ID: retuns an identifier of the prefix filter
  #+begin_src cpp
  static auto get_ID(const Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #9. get_byte_size: returns the size of the filter in bytes units
  #+begin_src cpp
  static size_t get_byte_size(const Table *table)
  #+end_src
  #10 . get_cap: returns the current capacity of the prefix filter
  #+begin_src cpp
  static size_t get_cap(const Table *table)
  #+end_src

** Redis

Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache,
message broker, and streaming engine. Redis provides data structures such as strings,
hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, etc. Redis has built-in replication,
Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence,
and provides high availability \cite{https://redis.io/docs/about/}.
Redis is one of the most popular technologies and became a synonym
for an In-Memory database. Furthermore, it repeatedly occures in the Stack Overflow’s
annual developer survey under "most loved databases" catagory.
\cite{https://redis.com/blog/redis-is-the-most-loved-database-for-the-4th-year-in-a-row/}.

*** The Redis modules interface

Redis modules make it possible to extend Redis functionality using external modules,
rapidly implementing new Redis commands with features similar to what can be done inside the core itself.
The full API that we used can be found in the official Redis documentation,
and among other things contains loading module, creating commands and working with
Redis module data objects.
\cite{https://redis.io/docs/reference/modules/}

* Challenges and solutions: what problems we encountered and how we solved them

** Developing on a remote host

Due to the fact that the prefix filter only runs and compiles on a
Linux hosts with an Intel processor with the AVX512 CPU vector
extension, the vast majority of the research and development work in
this project had to be carried out on a remote server that has this
extension.  This was challenging as we had to adapt our existing
development setups to achieve an efficient workflow.  To minimize the
cost of adapting to working on a remote development host, we leveraged
GNU Emacs with TRAMP\footnote{See https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/}
which allowed us to edit, compile and execute remote files seamlessly
while retaining the exact same setup and workflow we use for local
development.

** Preparing the prefix filter for embedding in a shared object

Unlike the original prefix filter implementation which built the
prefix filter as part of a standalone executable written solely in
C++, our requirement was to embed the prefix filter implementation in
a shared object that implements the Redis module ABI.  To do that we
wrote a Makefile that leverages =g++= to build a shared library from the
all of the C++ source files of the prefix filter along with our
=module.c= source file which implements the Redis module API.

** TODO Adapting the prefix filter interface to the Redis module interface :eshel:

** Creating a setup for high performance benchmarks



** Design

In high-level, the project is constructed from the following components:
- An implementation of the Prefix Filter data structure, adapted from
  [cite:@even2022prefix].
- A Redis module (shared library) exposing the Prefix Filter
  operations as Redis commands under the such as =PF.ADD=.
- A framework for running benchmarks against Redis filter modules.
- Scripts for instrumenting the Redis server.

Our Redis module is implemented in the C source file =module.c=, which
includes a header file called =redismodule.h= which defines the Redis
module API and ABI.  =module.c= further includes the header file
=wrappers.hpp= from our adapted Prefix Filter implementation, which
defines a generic API for filters in the C++ language.

In essence, =module.c= is tasked with implementing a bridge, or an
adapter, between the two interfaces.

*** Redis module initialization

As dictated by the Redis module API
[[https://redis.io/docs/reference/modules/]], our Redis module defines a
symbol =RedisModule_OnLoad=, implemented by a C function of the same
name in =module.c=.  The =OnLoad= function is invoked by the Redis runtime
upon loading a dynamic module, and its role is to initialize the
module and register any provided commands for later use.

The Redis module API provide the =RedisModule_Init= function for
initializing dynamic modules as part of their =OnLoad= routines.  Such
is the case also in our =OnLoad= implementation, which invokes
=RedisModule_Init= as its first step and registers through it the
command namespace =PF= for Prefix Filter commands.

Next, our =OnLoad= routine leverages the =RedisModule_CreateCommand=
function from the Redis module API to register a sequence of commands
for working with the underlying Prefix Filter through the Redis
interface.

*** Provided Redis Commands

**** =PF.RESERVE=

The =PF.RESERVE= command creates an empty Prefix Filter.  The command
takes two arguments, a =name= argument and a =capacity= argument.  The
=name= argument is a string that can later be used to refer to the
created filter, and the =capacity= argument is an integer used to set
its maximum capacity.

**** =PF.ADD=

The =PF.ADD= command adds an element to a Prefix Filter.  The command
takes two arguments, a =name= argument and an =item= argument.  The =name=
argument specifies which Prefix Filter to add to, and should match the
name given to that filter upon creation with =PF.RESERVE=.  The =item=
argument is a string to be added as an element to the filter.

**** =PF.EXISTS=

The =PF.EXISTS= command checks whether a given Prefix Filter contains a
specific element.  The command takes two arguments, a =name= argument
and an =item= argument.  The =name= argument specifies which Prefix Filter
to check for the element, and the =item= argument is the element to test
for existence in the table.  As is generally the case for filters,
this command may yield false positive results, meaning it may succeed
although the given element had never been inserted into the table.

**** =PF.MADD=

The =PF.MADD= command is an enhanced version of the =PF.ADD= command which
allows for specifying any number of elements to add to the given
Prefix Filter.  The first argument to =PF.MADD= is the name of the
Prefix Filter to add elements to, and the rest of the arguments are
treated as items to add to the filter.  The command returns an array
of integers, one for each input element.  The returned array contains
=1= in each index =i= such that that =i='th input element was newly added to
the filter, and =0= in the rest.

**** =PF.MEXISTS=

The =PF.MEXISTS=, similarly to =PF.MADD=, is an enhanced version of the
=PF.EXISTS= command which allows for specifying any number of elements
to to the given Prefix Filter.  The first argument to =PF.MADD= is the
name of the Prefix Filter to add elements to, and the rest of the
arguments are treated as items to add to the filter.  The command
returns an array of integers, which contains =1= in each index =i= such
that that =i='th input element exists in the filter, and =0= in the rest.

**** =PF.INFO=

The =PF.INFO= command takes a single argument, the name of an existing
Prefix Filter table and returns information about the status of the
table.

#+begin_src
127.0.0.1:6379> pf.reserve my_table 1024
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> pf.info my_table
1) Capacity
2) (integer) 1024
3) Filled
4) (integer) 0
5) Size
6) (integer) 1568
#+end_src

** Introduction

A Benchmark in Performance Testing is a metric or a point of reference
against which software products or services can be compared to assess
the quality measures. In other words, Benchmark means a set standard
that helps to determine the quality of a software product or a
service. We can benchmark a software product or service to assess its
quality.

We would like to compare the performance of the filters to determine
if there is any improvment by using the implemented data structure –
prefix filter. Filter data structures are used to test whether an
element is a member of a set. Particullary in redis, In-Memory filters
let us unswer that question in a near-realtime duration, so while
trying to compare the filters we should think about the filters's
latency while adding and querying data. We created performence tests
which measure the duration of the multi-add and multi-exists commands
under different amount of items in the command and increasing amount
of concurrent requests.

** Implementation

While creating the benchmarks, we decided to use the Golang programing language. Golang is expressive, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines. We also had previous experience with creating a Redis client in Go that is able to perform non-standard Redis commands by using Lua scripts.

We have created a generic test function which receive -
- N - number of iterations
- M - number of parallel tests
- F - function to be tested
and returns the average durtion of N iterations, each contains M concurrent callings to F.

The benchmark folder includes -
- redis - a Redis client which is able to perform non-standard Redis commands.
- scripts- Lua scripts which Redis can execute.
- utils - random strings generator and the generic test function.
- visualisation - a python program for visualizing the results.
- correctnessTests.go - validate the behavior of the implemented commands.
- loadTests.go - perform the benchmarks.

** Results

In every benchmark, we set N (number of iterations) to 50.

** Benchmark A
#+NAME:   fig:bench1
[[./testExistsPerNumberOfParalleledTests.png]]

** Benchmark B
#+NAME:   fig:bench2
[[./testMAddPerNumberOfItems.png]]
- In every MADD test there was just one call.

** Benchmark C
#+NAME:   fig:bench3
[[./testMAddPerNumberOfParalleledTests.png]]
- In every MADD command 10 records were added.

** Benchmark D
#+NAME:   fig:bench4
[[./testMExistsPerNumberOfItems.png]]
- In every MExists test there was just one call.

** Benchmark E
#+NAME:   fig:bench5
[[./testMExistsPerNumberOfItemsAlwaysNegative.png]]
- In every MExists test there was just one call.


As seen in the following graphs, prefix
filter in par with the state-of-the-art filters.

Although there is no improvement in any benchmark, the other filters
outperform prefix filter at most by a constant factor (and not by an
order of magnitude).
