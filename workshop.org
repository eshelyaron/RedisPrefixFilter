* TODO Introduction

* Background: what we learned about Redis and PF

** Prefix Filter
*** TODO Theory

In \cite{even2022prefix}, the authors present the Prefix Filter, an
incremental filter that aims to be near optimal in its space
requirements, and provide fast queries and insertions, in comparison
to state-of-the-art filters.

The prefix filter uses a novel approach for resolving hash collisions...

** TODO Developing on a remote host

** TODO Preparing the prefix filter for embedding in a shared object

** TODO Adapting the prefix filter interface to the Redis module interface

** TODO Creating a setup for high performance benchmarks

** Design

In high-level, the project is constructed from the following components:
- An implementation of the Prefix Filter data structure, adapted from
  [cite:@even2022prefix].
- A Redis module (shared library) exposing the Prefix Filter
  operations as Redis commands under the such as =PF.ADD=.
- A framework for running benchmarks against Redis filter modules.
- Scripts for instrumenting the Redis server.

Our Redis module is implemented in the C source file =module.c=, which
includes a header file called =redismodule.h= which defines the Redis
module API and ABI.  =module.c= further includes the header file
=wrappers.hpp= from our adapted Prefix Filter implementation, which
defines a generic API for filters in the C++ language.

In essence, =module.c= is tasked with implementing a bridge, or an
adapter, between the two interfaces.

*** Redis module initialization

As dictated by the Redis module API
[[https://redis.io/docs/reference/modules/]], our Redis module defines a
symbol =RedisModule_OnLoad=, implemented by a C function of the same
name in =module.c=.  The =OnLoad= function is invoked by the Redis runtime
upon loading a dynamic module, and its role is to initialize the
module and register any provided commands for later use.

The Redis module API provide the =RedisModule_Init= function for
initializing dynamic modules as part of their =OnLoad= routines.  Such
is the case also in our =OnLoad= implementation, which invokes
=RedisModule_Init= as its first step and registers through it the
command namespace =PF= for Prefix Filter commands.

Next, our =OnLoad= routine leverages the =RedisModule_CreateCommand=
function from the Redis module API to register a sequence of commands
for working with the underlying Prefix Filter through the Redis
interface.

*** Provided Redis Commands

**** =PF.RESERVE=

The =PF.RESERVE= command creates an empty Prefix Filter.  The command
takes two arguments, a =name= argument and a =capacity= argument.  The
=name= argument is a string that can later be used to refer to the
created filter, and the =capacity= argument is an integer used to set
its maximum capacity.

**** =PF.ADD=

The =PF.ADD= command adds an element to a Prefix Filter.  The command
takes two arguments, a =name= argument and an =item= argument.  The =name=
argument specifies which Prefix Filter to add to, and should match the
name given to that filter upon creation with =PF.RESERVE=.  The =item=
argument is a string to be added as an element to the filter.

**** =PF.EXISTS=

The =PF.EXISTS= command checks whether a given Prefix Filter contains a
specific element.  The command takes two arguments, a =name= argument
and an =item= argument.  The =name= argument specifies which Prefix Filter
to check for the element, and the =item= argument is the element to test
for existence in the table.  As is generally the case for filters,
this command may yield false positive results, meaning it may succeed
although the given element had never been inserted into the table.

**** =PF.MADD=

The =PF.MADD= command is an enhanced version of the =PF.ADD= command which
allows for specifying any number of elements to add to the given
Prefix Filter.  The first argument to =PF.MADD= is the name of the
Prefix Filter to add elements to, and the rest of the arguments are
treated as items to add to the filter.  The command returns an array
of integers, one for each input element.  The returned array contains
=1= in each index =i= such that that =i='th input element was newly added to
the filter, and =0= in the rest.

**** =PF.MEXISTS=

The =PF.MEXISTS=, similarly to =PF.MADD=, is an enhanced version of the
=PF.EXISTS= command which allows for specifying any number of elements
to to the given Prefix Filter.  The first argument to =PF.MADD= is the
name of the Prefix Filter to add elements to, and the rest of the
arguments are treated as items to add to the filter.  The command
returns an array of integers, which contains =1= in each index =i= such
that that =i='th input element exists in the filter, and =0= in the rest.

**** =PF.INFO=

The =PF.INFO= command takes a single argument, the name of an existing
Prefix Filter table and returns information about the status of the
table.

#+begin_src
127.0.0.1:6379> pf.reserve my_table 1024
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> pf.info my_table
1) Capacity
2) (integer) 1024
3) Filled
4) (integer) 0
5) Size
6) (integer) 1568

* Evaluation: Comparison of the filters (Bloom vs. cuckoo vs. prefix)

A Benchmark in Performance Testing is a metric or a point of reference
against which software products or services can be compared to assess
the quality measures. In other words, Benchmark means a set standard
that helps to determine the quality of a software product or a
service. We can benchmark a software product or service to assess its
quality.

We would like to compare the performance of the filters to determine
if there is any improvment by using the implemented data structure â€“
prefix filter. Filter data structures are used to test whether an
element is a member of a set. Particullary in redis, In-Memory filters
let us unswer that question in a near-realtime duration, so while
trying to compare the filters we should think about the filters's
latency while adding and querying data. We created performence tests
which measure the duration of the multi-add and multi-exists commands
under different amount of items in the command and increasing amount
of concurrent requests.

As seen in the following graphs, prefix
filter in par with the state-of-the-art filters.

Although there is no improvement in any benchmark, the other filters
outperform prefix filter at most by a constant factor (and not by an
order of magnitude).
